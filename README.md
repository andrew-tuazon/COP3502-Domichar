# COP3502-Domichar

In this assignment, you will write a function called printDomichar() that takes a string as its only argument and
prints that string to the screen, followed by some information about what the dominant (i.e., most frequently
occurring) type of character is in the string: vowels, consonants, or non-alphabetic characters. For example,
consider the following strings:
“APPLe” “_d_o_m_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_” “wee!” “b4n4n4” “cheese!!!”
The first string (“APPLe”) has two characters that are vowels, three characters that are consonants, and zero
characters that are non-alphabetic.1 Consonants are the dominant (most frequent) character type. Given that
string, the printDomichar() function should print the following to indicate that consonants are dominant:
APPLe (m:c)
